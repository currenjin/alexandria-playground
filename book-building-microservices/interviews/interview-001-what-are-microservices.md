## Answer
Microservices are independently deployable services modeled around a business domain.

### Key
- Independent deployment: each service can be deployed without affecting others
- Business domain focus: organized around capabilities like "orders" or "payments", not technical layers
- Decentralized data - each service owns its data

The key phrase is "independently deployable" - this is what distinguishes microservices from other service-oriented approaches.

## What NOT to say
- Small services: size is relative and not the defining characteristic
- Using containers: deployment mechanism, not architecture

## Follow-up prepared
- Benefits: technology heterogeneity, resilience, independent scaling
- Challenges: distributed transactions, operational complexity, monitoring

## Connection to experience
- Decided against full migration due to operational overhead
- Shows understanding of trade-offs, not just blindly following trends
